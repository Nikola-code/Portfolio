This repository contains my mini portfolio. It consists of the projects I have done over the past three months.

The Python folder contains assignments from the first 4 sections of the open-access Harvard course "CS50's Introduction to Programming with Python". The content of the assignments can be found at https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/. The bar on the left shows information regarding the sections that are discussed in the aforementioned course; after clicking on a given section, redirect (Problem set n) to the content of the tasks can be found at the very bottom of the page.

The HurryUp folder contains my own project, waiting to be implemented after the back-end is written. It is a website for an Escape Room located in Wroc≈Çaw. Its goal is to allow the users to learn about all of the services that the company is offering and to make a reservation for a particular room. Unfortunately, the reservation is still in the development stage :).

BonaAkademia folder contains a project that I created together with the Team members of this year's BonaAkademia at BonaSoft. It is a system that facilitates the management of employees in this particular company. It includes functionalities such as:
- assigning an employee to a project,
- assigning an employee to a team,
- setting a schedule
Unfortunately, we ran out of time to refine the project and ended the academy with its preliminary version.

Thank you for taking a look at my mini portfolio. I am very pleased that you cared to have a peek at it :).
